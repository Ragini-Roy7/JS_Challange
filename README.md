# JS_Challange
Personal JavaScript Learning Challenge — a hands-on, project-first journey rebuilding fundamentals and solving real problems with clean, testable code. Designed to showcase steady growth, practical skills, and a developer mindset recruiters can trust.
I restarted JavaScript with a better plan and a purpose: to turn interrupted learning into consistent, demonstrable progress. This repo is my personal JavaScript Learning Challenge — a curated collection of exercises, mini-projects, and real-world problem solutions that show how I learn, think, and build.
Instead of jumping theory-to-theory, I take each concept and put it into practice: clear goals, small iterations, focused improvements (readable code, tests, documentation), and a record of what I learned.
